## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lion, I'm a computer science student from germany with a parttime job writing airport simulation software.

All my hobby projects are on this github; the good, the bad and the ugly.

### Current Projects

- [a C++ game engine](https://github.com/lionkor/antsim3)
- [a string library](https://github.com/lionkor/String)
- Learning Ada
- Learning datastructures for uni by implementing them in C++ ([queue](https://github.com/lionkor/q), [binary search tree](https://github.com/lionkor/btree), ...)

### Collaboration

I'm always happy to contribute time and effort into any project that is looking for a C++ engineer.
