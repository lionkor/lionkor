### Hire me

I'm always looking around for opportunities as a fulltime software developer. Contact me via [EMail](mailto:development+gh@kortlepel.com).

### About Me

I enjoy writing and reviewing source code, optimizing and improving it. I'm very passionate about experimenting with low-level programming, performance optimization and ensuring high code quality in any projects I can get my hands on. 

All my hobby projects are on this github; the good, the bad and the ugly.

### Cool Projects
