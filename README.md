## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lion, I'm a passionate software developer! I work mostly on open-source and source-available projects, as well as a parttime job working on airport simulation software.

All my hobby projects are on this github; the good, the bad and the ugly. I'm from Germany.

â†’ You can also hire me [here](https://www.fiverr.com/s2/3e71171e41).

### Currently Active Projects

- Tech lead at [@RTSPlex](https://github.com/RTSPlex)
- Working as a developer on [BeamMP](https://beammp.com/) ([BeamMP-Server repository](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server)), the multiplayer mod for the game [BeamNG.drive](https://beamng.com)
- Working on [a custom language and compiler](https://github.com/lionkor/compiler-project)
- Writing Unix-y cli utilities like [hdump](https://github.com/lionkor/hdump) as a learning experience
- Learning [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

There are of course more projects, which you can almost all find in [my repositories](https://github.com/lionkor?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=), or on my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lionkor).
