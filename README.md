### About Me

I enjoy writing and reviewing source code, optimizing and improving it. I'm very passionate about experimenting with low-level programming, performance optimization and ensuring high code quality in any projects I can get my hands on. 

Next to my University study of informatics and my work in airport simulation software, I work on a few smaller open-source and source-available projects, and do lots of recreational programming. The most enjoyment I get from programming is when I get to solve larger issues on both a design- and implementation level, and I have a lot of experience doing so.

A lot of my personal projects, however, revolve around "re-inventing the wheel"; developing a common technology from the ground up, in order to learn about the internals and challenges, and to grow my understanding of it.

All my hobby projects are on this github; the good, the bad and the ugly.

### Currently Active Projects

- [A stack-based language with optimizing compiler and bytecode interpreter](https://github.com/lionkor/mcl)
- [A simple, fast, persistent (disk-backed) key-value store with REST API, written in C++](https://github.com/lionkor/kv-api)
- [A library for asynchronous terminal input/output](https://github.com/lionkor/commandline), similar to GNU getline

There are of course more projects, which you can almost all find in [my repositories](https://github.com/lionkor?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=), or on my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lionkor).

### Collaboration

I'm always happy to contribute time and effort into any project that is looking for a C++, C or Rust engineer. Contact me via [email](mailto:development@kortlepel.com) if you are interested in a partnership.
