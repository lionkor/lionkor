## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lion, I'm a computer science student from germany with a parttime job writing airport simulation software.

All my hobby projects are on this github; the good, the bad and the ugly.

### Currently Active Projects

- A modern C++ message library [`lk::msg`](https://github.com/lionkor/lkmsg)
- Writing Unix-y cli utilities like [hdump](https://github.com/lionkor/hdump) as a learning experience
- [a C++ game engine](https://github.com/lionkor/antsim3)
- Learning datastructures for uni by implementing them in C++ ([queue](https://github.com/lionkor/q), [binary search tree](https://github.com/lionkor/btree), ...)
- Writing a game or two

There are of course more projects, which you can almost all find in [my repositories](https://github.com/lionkor?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=). 

### Collaboration

I'm always happy to contribute time and effort into any project that is looking for a C++ engineer. Contact me via [email](mailto:development@kortlepel.com) if you are interested in a partnership.
