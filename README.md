I'm Lion, I'm a software developer! I work mostly on open-source and source-available projects, as well as a parttime job working on airport simulation software.

### About Me

I enjoy writing and reviewing source code, optimizing and improving it. I'm very passionate about experimenting with low-level programming, performance optimization and ensuring high code quality in any projects I can get my hands on. 

Next to my University study of informatics and my work in airport simulation software, I work on a few smaller open-source and source-available projects, and do lots of recreational programming. The most enjoyment I get from programming is when I get to solve larger issues on both a design- and implementation level, and I have a lot of experience doing so.

A lot of my personal projects, however, revolve around "re-inventing the wheel"; developing a common technology from the ground up, in order to learn about the internals and challenges, and to grow my understanding of it.

All my hobby projects are on this github; the good, the bad and the ugly.

### Currently Active Projects

- Tech lead at [@RTSPlex](https://github.com/RTSPlex)
- Working as a developer on [BeamMP](https://beammp.com/) ([BeamMP-Server repository](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server)), the multiplayer mod for the game [BeamNG.drive](https://beamng.com)
- A [http server](https://github.com/lionkor/http) in C
- A cross-platform socket wrapper in C++20: [lionkor/net](https://github.com/lionkor/net)
- [A custom language and compiler](https://github.com/lionkor/compiler-project) in order to learn more about compilers
- Unix-y cli utilities like [hdump](https://github.com/lionkor/hdump) as a learning experience

There are of course more projects, which you can almost all find in [my repositories](https://github.com/lionkor?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=), or on my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/lionkor).

### Collaboration

I'm always happy to contribute time and effort into any project that is looking for a C++ engineer. Contact me via [email](mailto:development@kortlepel.com) if you are interested in a partnership.
