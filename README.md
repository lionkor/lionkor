### About Me

I enjoy writing and reviewing source code, optimizing and improving it. I'm very passionate about experimenting with low-level programming, performance optimization and ensuring high code quality in any projects I can get my hands on. 

Next to my University study of informatics and my work in airport simulation software, I work on a few smaller open-source and source-available projects, and do lots of recreational programming. The most enjoyment I get from programming is when I get to solve larger issues on both a design- and implementation level, and I have a lot of experience doing so.

A lot of my personal projects, however, revolve around "re-inventing the wheel"; developing a common technology from the ground up, in order to learn about the internals and challenges, and to grow my understanding of it.

All my hobby projects are on this github; the good, the bad and the ugly.
